# Wave Portal

Wave Portal is a website where anyone on the internet can learn a little about I am and send a ğŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.

So in this case, we want people to ğŸ‘‹ at us. The bigger picture here is:
1. Write a smart contract. That contract has all the logic around how the ğŸ‘‹ s are handled. This is like the server code.
2. The smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain. This way, anyone in the world will be able to access and run the smart contract (if we give them permission to do so). So, pretty much like a server :).
3. Build a client website that will let people easily interact with our smart contract on the blockchain.
